## R
R language code for multivariate statistical analysis and visualization
### 1.CCA.R
The codes about canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) for exploring key explanatory factors of nosZI composition.
### 2.Mantel.R
The codes about Mantel tests for exploring key explanatory factors of nosZI composition.
### 3.NMDS.R
Beta diversity of nosZI communities was assessed using non-metric multidimensional scale (NMDS), with significance tested by analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance‌ (PERMANOVA).
### 4.PCA.R
The first principal component obtained through principal component analysis (PCA) represents the nutrients (total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen) as well as the carbon base (organic carbon content and soil organic carbon).
### 5.ggmanel.R
Involves exploring the main components in the Spearman correlation that are related to microbial beta diversity.
